# Portfolio v1

My first attempt at creating a portfolio to showcase my software projects. Follow [this link](https://github.com/marorcas/marorcas.github.io) to see my most recent version!

## Description

A portfolio website built with HTML, Sassy CSS and JavaScript. 

This portfolio contains the following sections:
- A landing page with my name and title
- An about page giving a brief overview about myself 
- A skills page with all the tech tools that I learned how to use so far
- A project page where I can display all my future projects, where I displayed placeholder projects and each placeholder project opens up a modal
- A contact page with contact details

## Things I learned while building this project

- Used BEM as a naming convention
- Took the opportunity to familiarise myself with working with Git and Github
- Learned how to make a basic modal

## Things I can improve 

- Responsiveness is not perfect
- Learn how to dynamically generate the correct content for the project modal to display
- Design is not great - hard to read in some sections because of the background
